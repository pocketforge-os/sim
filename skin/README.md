# skin/ — tsp-an4.6: clickable skin renderer + manufacturer>device picker (the AVD north star)

A small SDL3 host GUI that renders the **clickable AVD-style skin** for a device and an
Android-style **manufacturer > device picker** (TrimUI > 5040 / 5050). It is a **client of the
.5 control surface**, not a second injection path: a click on a skin rect resolves — through the
*same* descriptor — to the *same* `control_surface.Device` call the headless test injects. ONE
descriptor (`platform/devices/<id>/capabilities.toml`) → app + simulator + test + **SKIN**.

```
   click btn_south's rect ─┐                         ┌─ headless test: dev.press("south")
                           ├─► skin_model resolves ──┤   (.5 check-control.py)
   (GUI, this wall)        │   to Action("press",    │
                           │   "south") ─► dev.press ─┘   IDENTICAL call, IDENTICAL effect
```

| file | what |
|------|------|
| `skin_model.py`   | the toolkit-agnostic **brains**: the picker (scanned from `[identity]`), the raw `[skin.parts]` rects in skin-image space, hit-test + gesture→`control_surface` Action, and the compositor geometry (canvas fb → `display_rect`). Reused by both the renderer and the proof. |
| `skin-render.c`   | the **SDL3 renderer** (tsp-osr-safe). Composites bezel `body.png` + per-control `body_lit.png` overlay + the live virtual fb (into `display_rect`) + the picker panel. `--shot OUT.ppm` (offscreen, the proof + owner artifacts) or `--window` (live mouse → stdout clicks; needs a video-capable SDL3 + a display). |
| `check-skin.py`   | the **headless proof** (sibling of `.5`'s `check-control.py`): GUI-click == headless-inject, compositor geometry, per-variant zero-code, both descriptors. Emits the owner AVD shots. |
| `build-skin-render.sh`, `run-skin.sh` | build the renderer / run the whole proof on modelmaker. |
| `gen-font.py`, `font8x13.h` | the committed bitmap font (generated once with PIL on the laptop; the C build needs no PIL/SDL_ttf/SDL_image). |
| `baseline/<id>/avd_*.png` | the rendered AVD skins (the **owner visual-OK** artifacts). |

## The coordinate-space distinction (why .6 ≠ .5)

`.5`'s `layout.py` **fits** the skin parts into the 1280×720 `render_canvas`, because the `.5`
*app* draws the controls *into* that canvas. **`.6` is different**: the GUI draws the real bezel
`body.png` at **skin-image resolution** (1480×640) and hit-tests the **raw** `[skin.parts]` rects
(skin space). So `.6` reuses `layout.load_descriptor` + `part_for_input` but **not** the
canvas-fit rects. The live fb still comes from the `.5` control surface (canvas space) and is
composited into the bezel's `display_rect`.

## Rotation is DATA, not silicon

The fb the app renders is the landscape 1280×720 `render_canvas`. It composites into the bezel's
`display_rect` (872×490, also landscape). The composite orientation is **data-driven**: we use
whichever of `{canvas, rotate(canvas, screens.rotation)}` has the aspect matching `display_rect`
— for a133/a523 that is the canvas itself (`composite_rotation = none`), confirmed empirically
(a red marker at the canvas top-left lands at the screen top-left). `screens.rotation = cw90` is
the **per-SoC panel-mount mechanism** (A133 legacy disp2 / A523 DRM-KMS) that the descriptor's
own note flags as *"per-SoC CODE, not data here"* — the sim does **not** reproduce it (HONESTY
CONTRACT item 5). It is carried as data so a variant whose `display_rect` matched the rotated
dims would Just Work with zero per-device code.

## What this proves — and the HONESTY CONTRACT

**Proves (logical layer):** the picker lists every skinned variant from `[identity]`; a click on
each `[skin.parts]` rect injects the correct input id through the `.5` control surface (==
the headless inject); analog drags scale to `set_axis`/`set_stick`; a523 sticks are clickable
(L3/R3) while a133's are not — a pure-**DATA** difference, zero per-device code; absent controls
raise typed `hardware-absent`; the live fb composites into `display_rect` with the data-driven
rotation. Verified by **deterministic region sampling**, never a VLM (tsp-visual-inspection's
hallucination caveat).

**Does NOT prove (stays the flash→serial→webcam gate's authority):** GPU blobs / the
PowerVR→dc_sunxi→DE2.0→fb0 path (the software-render fb proves nothing on-device); real WiFi;
timing/thermal; isolation/enforcement; **per-SoC graphics** (A133 sunxifb/no-KMS vs A523
kmsdrm/Mali). The "zero per-device code" claim is for the **I/O + skin layer only**.

## Run (modelmaker)

```bash
# inner loop: edit on the laptop, rsync to mm, run heavy fb/qemu on mm
rsync -az --exclude baseline/ --exclude __pycache__/ skin/ mm@10.0.40.90:/home/mm/sim/skin/

ssh mm@10.0.40.90 'cd /home/mm/sim/skin && \
  QEMU_TSP=/home/mm/qemu-tsp/build/qemu-tsp/qemu-aarch64 \
  SDLR=/home/mm/sim-build/sdl3-render \
  ROOTFS=/home/mm/sim-build/harness/rootfs-arm64 \
  PLATFORM=/home/mm/platform \
  bash run-skin.sh'          # => ALL DEVICES PASS (a133 a523)
```

`--window` live mode (laptop with a display + a video-capable SDL3) opens the bezel; clicks are
written to stdout as `click <skin_x> <skin_y>` / `pick <codename>` for a driver to apply to a
`control_surface.Device`. The offscreen `--shot` path is the CI/acceptance path and needs no
display. **T0 desktop preview** for fast skin iteration is the `--shot` path with a synthetic fb
— explicitly **NOT the appliance binary**.

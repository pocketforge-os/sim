"""neg-control-drop-south.py — infra-113 B1 NEGATIVE CONTROL (tsp-65jc.3). DO NOT MERGE.

Deletes exactly ONE descriptor-backed assertion input — the a133 `[[inputs]]` row with
`id = "south"` (the A button, EV_KEY/BTN_A) — from a `capabilities.toml`, to PROVE the sim
CI gate goes RED on descriptor-level breakage. With the "south" row gone, check-control's
HEADLINE assertion (`dev.press("south"); assert framebuffer_region("south").is_red()`) can
no longer bind, so the gate FAILS — which is the whole point of the negative control.

This file exists only on a throwaway branch whose PR closes UNMERGED; the recorded RED run
URL is the deliverable, not a green PR. Usage: neg-control-drop-south.py <capabilities.toml>
